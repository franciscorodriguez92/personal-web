Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a senior data scientist and NLP/LLM researcher based in Valais, Switzerland.  Over the past nine years, Iâ€™ve worked at the intersection of academia and industry, building machine learning systems end to end. My main focus is on large language models â€” from data preparation and fine-tuning to evaluation and deployment in production. Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked on retrieval-augmented generation, predictive analytics, and customer intelligence.  

## What I do best
- **NLP & LLMs**: adapting models to specific domains, evaluating systems, and exploring safety and bias  
- **Production ML**: building reliable data pipelines, setting up CI/CD for models, feature stores, monitoring, and A/B testing  
- **Analytics that drive impact**: translating raw feedback, support tickets, or chats into clear insights and decisions  


## Current work
At **Hilti AG**, I focus on customer feedback intelligence, retention modeling, and building scalable ML pipelines that power analytics and operational tools.  

I also collaborate with **UNEDâ€™s NLP group** on projects around bias mitigation, multilingual sexism detection, and LLM fine-tuning. I co-led the **EXIST shared task** and created the **MeTwo** dataset.
